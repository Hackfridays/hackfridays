# Internal Hack Friday projects
On Fridays, we work on Hack Friday projects. This markdown is a first effort in collating past projects, as well as projects that are currently in progress or are being thought about.

In time, the aim is to integrate all the hack projects fully with GitHub, with this markdown providing a quick summary of links, requirements, team compositions and outstanding work, amongst other things.

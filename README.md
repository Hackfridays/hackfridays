# Internal Hack Friday projects
On Fridays, we work on Hack Friday projects. This markdown is a first effort in collating past projects, as well as projects that are currently in progress or are being thought about.

In time, the aim is to integrate all the hack projects fully with GitHub, with this markdown providing a quick summary of links, requirements, team compositions and outstanding work, amongst other things.

## MuchVote
### Description
MuchVote was created as a way to collect opinions instead of asking for people to rise their hands counting them.

The backend was made using Python-Flask and MySQL database.
The frontend is an multiplatform mobile application (Android & iOS) made using ReactNative.

The application provides two ways of voting: using numerals (0-9) and using a set colors. It also allows for offline and online voting with a simple result page for the online part.
